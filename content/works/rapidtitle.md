RapidTitle leverages an intelligent API platform that interfaces with all titling participants and rapidly completes the process.
RapidTitle is an online portal that allows buyers, sellers, lenders, motor vehicle associations, title agents and notaries to come together using digital identities, smart contracts and our secure TitleVault in order to facilitate high speed transactions.

This project still as work in progress, i had the opportunity to chose the frontend technologies and decided to implement Zustand which i head of many times before and decided to give it a try, i really like it, it's a really simple state management library and it's really easy to implement.
As i mentioned before this project still in progress and i'm still working on it, i'm really excited to see the final result.
