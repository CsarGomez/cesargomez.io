This project is kind of an automotive matchmakers.  
They have relationships with hundreds of purchasing dealers, both locally and nationally, searching for the right car.  
Highroad connects sellers with buyers that are searching for the car you have to offer, ensuring you get convenience and safety.

For this project i had to work with a team of 3 developers including me, two frontend and one backend developer.  
I was part of the frontend team it was a great experience because I the other developer had more experience than me and i could learn a lot from him.  
Regards the backend was good to get in touch with C# and learn the basic concepts, as well learn a couple things about Postgres.

I know that they did a bit of changes after we finish the project, but i think that the main idea is still there.
