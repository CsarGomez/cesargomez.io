Guess the word in six intents.

> website: [Word Game](https://word-game-wheat.vercel.app)  
> stack: React, TypeScript, Vercel

The main goal with this project was to challenge myself and build something similar to [Wordle](https://wordlegame.org).
I have to say that i really enjoyed this project, is always fun to work React and TypeScript.  
Great challenge to practice React and TypeScript, its always good to practice with this kind of projects to keep the basic concepts fresh and includes new things like toast components.  
At the end you can come with a nice project.
